# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Major Features
- **Gateway OTLP metrics in the per-pod sidecar**: when `spec.monitoring.enabled=true`, the OTel Collector sidecar now exposes an OTLP/gRPC receiver on `127.0.0.1:4317` and the documentdb-gateway is configured (via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_METRICS_ENABLED`) to push its `db_client_*` metrics there. The sidecar's existing prometheus exporter re-exports them alongside the existing `documentdb.postgres.up` sqlquery output, with per-pod attribution added by the collector's resource processor. No new CRD fields; this turns on automatically wherever monitoring was already enabled.
- **Two-Phase Extension Upgrade**: New `spec.schemaVersion` field separates binary upgrades (`spec.documentDBVersion`) from irreversible schema migrations (`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`). The default behavior gives you a rollback-safe window — update the binary first, validate, then finalize the schema. Set `schemaVersion: "auto"` for single-step upgrades in development environments. See the [upgrade guide](docs/operator-public-documentation/preview/operations/upgrades.md) for details.

### Breaking Changes
- **`DocumentDBSpec` restructured into main + `advanced` stanzas**: Expert-mode and rarely-touched fields moved into a new `spec.advanced` sub-object, with postgres-runtime knobs nested one level deeper under `spec.advanced.postgres`. The main spec now only contains user-facing options (node/instance count, resources, version, credentials, TLS, monitoring, etc.). Affected fields:
  - Moved to `spec.advanced.*`: `documentDBImage`, `gatewayImage`, `postgresImage`, `imagePullSecrets`, `sidecarInjectorPluginName`, `walReplicaPluginName`, `affinity` (now `*pointer`), `timeouts` (now `*pointer`).
  - Moved to `spec.advanced.postgres.*`: `postgresUID`/`postgresGID` (renamed `uid`/`gid`), `preloadLibraries`, `postInitSQL`.
  - `spec.advanced.postgres.uid` and `gid` must be set together (CEL rule).
  - `spec.advanced.postgresImage` retains its CRD-level default of `ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-minimal-trixie`.
  - Combined-image-mode detection is preserved: leaving `spec.advanced.documentDBImage` empty (including the entire `spec.advanced` block being absent) keeps the existing default behaviour.
  Existing CRs that reference the old flat field names must be migrated to the new paths before applying the upgraded CRD. See the [API reference](docs/operator-public-documentation/preview/api-reference.md) for the full new shape.
- **Validating webhook added**: A new `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` enforces that `spec.schemaVersion` never exceeds the binary version and blocks `spec.documentDBVersion` rollbacks below the committed schema version. This requires [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to be installed in the cluster (it is already a prerequisite for the sidecar injector). Existing clusters upgrading to this release will have the webhook activated automatically via `helm upgrade`.
- **Removed `Disabled` TLS gateway mode**: The `spec.tls.gateway.mode: Disabled` option has been removed to eliminate the security risk of plaintext Mongo wire protocol traffic. Previously, `Disabled` mode served connections in plaintext, contradicting the `Disabled` tab in `tls.md` which described the mode as a self-signed bootstrap. Empty or unset mode now defaults to `SelfSigned`, and the controller fails closed (also defaulting to `SelfSigned`) if a legacy `Disabled` value is encountered on a stored object. Users with `mode: Disabled` should remove this setting or explicitly set `mode: SelfSigned` — the gateway will automatically use a cert-manager generated self-signed certificate. See [issue #356](https://github.com/documentdb/documentdb-kubernetes-operator/issues/356) for details.

### Testing infrastructure
- **Unified E2E test suite ([#346](https://github.com/documentdb/documentdb-kubernetes-operator/pull/346))**: The four legacy end-to-end workflows (`test-integration.yml`, `test-E2E.yml`, `test-backup-and-restore.yml`, `test-upgrade-and-rollback.yml`) and their bash / JavaScript (mongosh) / Python (pymongo) glue have been replaced by a single Go / Ginkgo v2 / Gomega suite under `test/e2e/`. Specs are organised by CRD operation (lifecycle, scale, data, performance, backup, tls, feature gates, exposure, status, upgrade), reuse CloudNative-PG's `tests/utils` packages as a library, and speak the Mongo wire protocol via `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/v2`.

### Breaking changes for contributors
- **Local E2E invocation changed.** Tests are now run via `ginkgo` against an already-provisioned cluster, not via `npm test` / bash scripts. Typical invocation:
  ```bash
  cd test/e2e
  ginkgo -r --label-filter=smoke ./tests/...
  ```
  Label selection replaces per-workflow entry points; depth is controlled by `TEST_DEPTH` (0=Highest … 4=Lowest). See [`test/e2e/README.md`](test/e2e/README.md) for prereqs, the full env-var table (including `E2E_RUN_ID` and the `E2E_UPGRADE_*` upgrade-suite variables), and troubleshooting.
- **Design rationale** for the migration — scope, fixture tiers, parallelism model, CNPG reuse strategy — is documented in [`docs/designs/e2e-test-suite.md`](docs/designs/e2e-test-suite.md).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Major Features
- **ImageVolume Deployment**: The operator uses ImageVolume (GA in Kubernetes 1.35) to mount the DocumentDB extension as a separate image alongside a standard PostgreSQL base image
- **DocumentDB Upgrade Support**: Configurable PostgresImage and ImageVolume extensions for seamless upgrades
- **Sync Service & ChangeStreams**: DocumentDB sync service and ChangeStreams feature gate
- **Affinity Configuration**: Pod scheduling passthrough for affinity rules
- **PersistentVolume Management**: PV retention, security mount options, and PV recovery support
- **CNPG In-Place Updates**: Support for CloudNative-PG in-place updates

### Breaking Changes
- **Kubernetes 1.35+ required**: The legacy combined-image deployment mode for Kubernetes < 1.35 has been removed. Kubernetes 1.35+ is now required.
- **Deb-based container images**: Container images switched from source-compiled builds to deb-based packages under `ghcr.io/documentdb/documentdb-kubernetes-operator/`. The extension and gateway are now separate images with versioned tags (e.g., `:0.109.0`).
- **PostgreSQL base image changed to Debian trixie**: The default `postgresImage` changed from `postgresql:18-minimal-bookworm` to `postgresql:18-minimal-trixie` (Debian 13) to satisfy the deb-based extension's GLIBC requirements. Existing clusters that don't explicitly set `postgresImage` will use the new base on upgrade.

### Bug Fixes
- Gateway pods now restart when TLS secret name changes
- Fixed PV labeling for multi-cluster lookups
- Fixed Go toolchain vulnerabilities (upgraded to 1.25.8)
